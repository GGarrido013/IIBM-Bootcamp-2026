**Instructors**: Jorge González (jfgonzalez5@uc.cl) & Gabriel Garrido (gagarrido@uc.cl)


The IIBM Bootcamp will be held between January 19 and 23 of 2026. During these 5 days, practical exercises in relation to the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming languages, Calculus and Algebra will be taught, been the main objective to prepare students of the postgraduate programs of the [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering (IIBM)](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/) with tools that will be necessary to succeed in the different courses of the Masters and Ph.D. programs.

Jupyter notebooks and scripts for each day will be uploaded here at the end of the day.

## **Learning Objetives**
* Adcquire basic programming skills
* Apply programming tools
* Design basic scripts
* Explain chosen methods and obtained results to an interdisciplinary and diverse audience
* Contrast the results critically and respectfully with different people
